"""critique.py — get critique of a paragraph YOU have written.

This script does NOT rewrite your prose. It identifies issues you should fix.
You decide what to do about them.

Usage:
    ./critique.py drafts/ch1_para_3.md \\
        --job "Establish NUMT contamination as a clinically significant problem"

    # Diff mode: output as unified-diff style annotations alongside your draft.
    ./critique.py drafts/ch1_para_3.md --job "..." --diff

    # Or paste from stdin (e.g. copy from Google Docs):
    pbpaste | ./critique.py --stdin \\
        --job "..." --model gemini

## Job this paragraph must do

## My paragraph (written by me)
{draft}

## Your task

Identify issues with this paragraph. Be specific and direct. Cover:

1. **Clarity**: What is unclear or could be misread?
2. **Argument**: What claim is unsupported, hand-wavy, or overstated?
3. **Citations**: What claim seems to need a citation but lacks one? What citation would strengthen a specific sentence?
4. **Committee challenge**: What would a skeptical thesis committee member object to or ask about?
5. **Job fit**: Does the paragraph actually do the job stated above? If not, what's missing or off-topic?
6. **Structure**: Is the paragraph well-ordered, or do ideas come in a confusing sequence?

Format as a numbered list under each heading. Be concise. Do NOT rewrite the paragraph.
Do NOT provide replacement prose. If a sentence is weak, say WHY it is weak, not how to fix it.

You may NOT propose replacement wording. You may only point at sentences.

## Job this paragraph must do
{job}

## My paragraph (one sentence per line, numbered)
{numbered}

## Your task

For each sentence number, output AT MOST one annotation line in the form:

  S<n> [TAG]: short critique question (no replacement prose).

Tags (use the most specific one):
  CLARITY     — unclear or could be misread
  CLAIM       — unsupported or hand-wavy claim
  CITE        — needs a citation
  OVERREACH   — overstated relative to evidence
  ORDER       — comes out of logical sequence
  OFF_JOB     — does not contribute to the stated job
  COMMITTEE   — a committee member would object here

If a sentence is fine, omit it from your output entirely. Do NOT write
replacement sentences. Do NOT quote more than 6 consecutive words from
my paragraph. End your output with one line:

  SUMMARY: <one sentence on the paragraph's overall problem, if any>
