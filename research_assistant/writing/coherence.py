"""coherence.py — check multi-paragraph flow for a thesis chapter.

For each pair of adjacent paragraphs, asks: does paragraph N+1 follow from
paragraph N? Reports breaks in topic flow, redundant paragraphs, and
whether the chapter collectively delivers its stated thesis.

Does NOT rewrite. Outputs a critique with paragraph indices.

Usage:
    ./coherence.py drafts/chapter1.md --thesis "NUMT filtering is mandatory for clinical mtDNA pipelines"
    ./coherence.py drafts/ch1.md --thesis "..." --model sonnet

Do NOT rewrite. Identify issues only.

## Chapter thesis (what this chapter must deliver)
{thesis}

## Numbered paragraphs (truncated for transition focus)
{paragraphs}

## Your task — produce a structured report with these sections

### 1. Topic-flow breaks
List paragraph pairs (N → N+1) where the transition is abrupt, missing,
or the order seems wrong. Quote one short phrase from each side to anchor
the issue. For each break, say WHY it breaks (new topic without bridge,
out-of-order step, etc.).

### 2. Redundancy
Identify paragraphs that restate earlier paragraphs. Cite paragraph numbers
and the specific overlapping claim. Do NOT suggest merged prose.

### 3. Thesis support
For each paragraph, mark one of:
  - SUPPORTS (advances the thesis)
  - SETS_UP (necessary background)
  - OFF_TOPIC (does not contribute)
  - WEAKENS (raises an objection that is not handled)

Then summarize: which paragraphs are doing the heavy lifting, and which
should be cut or relocated.

### 4. Missing pieces
What the chapter would need to make the thesis fully defensible. Be
specific (e.g. "no paragraph addresses cost of filtering" or "no
quantitative comparison with X"). Do NOT propose replacement prose.

### 5. Recommended paragraph order
A reordered list of paragraph numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 3, 5) IF the current
order is suboptimal. If it is fine, say "Current order is sound" and
explain in one line why.

Be specific. Be concise. Reference paragraphs by number. Never write
prose I could paraphrase into the draft.
