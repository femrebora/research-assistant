HUMAN_PROSE = "Molecular dynamics simulations generate ensembles of protein conformations. These ensembles can reveal transient binding pockets not visible in static crystal structures. Identifying these pockets remains a computational challenge."

AI_PROSE = "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the intricate interplay between molecular dynamics simulations and protein conformations. Moreover, it is crucial to highlight the pivotal role of robust computational frameworks. Furthermore, the results underscore the groundbreaking nature of these findings, which shed light on the complex dynamics. Additionally, the approach leverages synergistic interactions. Taken together, these observations pave the way for future research. In conclusion, this study opens new avenues for investigation."

EM_DASH_PROSE = "The pipeline processes data in three stages—parsing, clustering, and ranking—before output. This approach—while effective—has limitations."

LONG_SENTENCES = "The computational pipeline described in this paper integrates trajectory parsing with geometry-based pocket detection using a modified version of the p2rank algorithm that assigns per-residue binding probabilities to each putative site, and these probabilities are then used as feature vectors for density-based clustering across simulation frames with an automatically tuned DBSCAN implementation that maximizes the silhouette coefficient over a grid of candidate hyperparameters."

MANY_COMMAS = "First, we parse the trajectory, then we detect pockets, then we cluster them, then we rank them, and finally we output the results."

ROADMAP = "This paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the methods in detail. The subsequent sections report the results, discuss the findings, and conclude with future directions."
