**research-assistant** is a local first academic research workspace for thesis helper, literature review, citation-aware drafting, paper discovery, model comparison, and transparent AI assisted research workflows.

It combines a Flask Web UI, Zotero-indexed retrieval, multi-model comparison, academic writing tools, AI usage disclosure logs, and PaperForge, a multi-agent paper drafting pipeline.

The goal is to help researchers work with their own papers, ask better questions, compare model outputs, write more structured drafts, and keep AI-assisted research transparent.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/femrebora/research-assistant
cd research-assistant
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/install_cli.sh
research-assistant
```

Your browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5050`.

The setup script creates a Python virtual environment, installs the package, creates a `.env` file, and prepares default research folders.

The install script copies a small wrapper to `~/.local/bin/research-assistant`. For the `ra` shortcut, add this line to your `~/.bashrc` (optional — the installer prints the exact line):

```bash
alias ra="research-assistant"
```

### Start and stop

```bash
ra          # Start the app, or reopen the browser if already running
ra stop     # Stop the background server
```

Closing the browser or terminal does **not** stop the app — it keeps running in the background. After restarting your computer, just type `ra` again.

If something is wrong, run `ra doctor` for a full diagnostic report.

### How the shell configuration works

The installer (`scripts/install_cli.sh`) copies a wrapper script to `~/.local/bin/research-assistant`. It does **not** modify your `~/.bashrc` — you control your own shell configuration.

To use the `ra` shortcut, add these two lines to your shell config by hand:

**1. Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH** — so the `research-assistant` command can be found:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**2. Add the `ra` alias** — so you can type `ra` instead of `research-assistant`:

```bash
alias ra="research-assistant"
```

#### To add them manually

Open your shell config file with a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Paste the two lines above at the end, then save (`Ctrl+O`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`). Finally, reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### If the project directory is moved or deleted

The installed wrapper detects at runtime whether the project directory still exists. If you move or delete the repo, running `research-assistant` prints a clear error telling you what happened and how to fix it — instead of a cryptic "No such file" crash.

#### If you use a different shell

| Shell | Config file | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bash | `~/.bashrc` | Most Linux defaults |
| Zsh | `~/.zshrc` | macOS default |
| Fish | `~/.config/fish/config.fish` | Uses different syntax — see [Fish docs](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#path) |

For Fish, the PATH line is different:

```fish
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin
```

But the alias (`alias ra="research-assistant"`) works the same.

### Reference: all commands

```bash
ra                  # Start or reopen (the only command you need daily)
ra stop             # Stop the background server
ra restart          # Stop and start again
ra status           # Show whether the server is running
ra logs             # View recent server logs
ra logs -f          # Follow logs live (Ctrl+C to exit)
ra doctor           # Run system diagnostics
ra open             # Open the browser (don't start server)
ra config           # Show configuration file paths
```

These commands also work with the full name `research-assistant` (e.g. `research-assistant doctor`) if you prefer.

### npm users

If you prefer npm over the shell scripts:

```bash
npm run setup       # First time setup
npm run start       # Start or reopen
npm run stop        # Stop
npm run restart     # Restart
npm run status      # Server status
npm run doctor      # Diagnostics
```

## First time setup checklist

After starting the Web UI, follow this order:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Step</th>
      <th>Where to go</th>
      <th>What to do</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td><code>/settings</code></td>
      <td>Add at least one model provider API key or configure a CLI provider.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td><code>/providers</code></td>
      <td>Test that the selected provider works before writing or indexing. Click "▷ Test" next to each model alias.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td><code>/settings</code></td>
      <td>Add Zotero user ID, Zotero API key, <code>THESIS_ROOT</code>, and <code>ZOTERO_STORAGE</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><code>/index-setup</code></td>
      <td>Index Zotero PDFs so the Ask and Evidence tools can retrieve from your own papers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td><code>/projects</code></td>
      <td>Create or update the active research project with title, research question, hypothesis, keywords, citation style, and supervisor notes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td><code>/ask</code></td>
      <td>Ask a small test question to confirm that citations and retrieved evidence are working.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Configuration

You can configure the application from the browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5050/settings
```

The settings page lets you edit API keys, Zotero configuration, provider commands, paths, and timeouts. Changes are written back to your `.env` file automatically.

You only need one model provider to start.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Changing which model each alias points to

Each model alias can be overridden with an environment variable in your `.env` file. This lets you switch to newer models without editing source code:

```bash
# Override individual model IDs (LiteLLM format)
RA_MODEL_CLAUDE=anthropic/claude-opus-4-8
RA_MODEL_SONNET=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
RA_MODEL_GPT=openai/gpt-5
RA_MODEL_GEMINI=gemini/gemini-2.5-pro
# …and so on for every alias: haiku, flash, deepseek, gpt-mini, codex, local
```

The pattern is `RA_MODEL_<ALIAS>` where `<ALIAS>` is the model key in uppercase (hyphens become underscores).

For Zotero integration, configure these values from `/settings` or directly in `.env`:

```bash
ZOTERO_USER_ID=1234567
ZOTERO_API_KEY=...
THESIS_ROOT=/home/you/thesis
ZOTERO_STORAGE=/home/you/Zotero/storage
```

Check provider health from:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5050/providers
```

Model calls are logged under:

```text
~/thesis/logs/
```

These logs can be used to prepare AI usage disclosure text for thesis, manuscript, or institutional transparency requirements.

## How to organize your work

The tool works best when each thesis, manuscript, or review article has a clear folder inside `THESIS_ROOT`.

Recommended structure:

```text
~/thesis/
├── projects/
│   └── my-thesis-project/
│       ├── drafts/
│       ├── notes/
│       ├── outlines/
│       ├── evidence/
│       ├── exports/
│       └── paperforge/
├── logs/
├── indexes/
└── disclosures/
```

Suggested use for each folder:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Folder</th>
      <th>Save here</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>drafts/</code></td>
      <td>Thesis chapters, manuscript sections, revised paragraphs, and long form writing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>notes/</code></td>
      <td>Your own reading notes, supervisor comments, meeting notes, and research ideas.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>outlines/</code></td>
      <td>Generated outlines, chapter plans, article structures, and section maps.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>evidence/</code></td>
      <td>Important cited answers, claim verification outputs, citation audit results, and evidence tables.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>exports/</code></td>
      <td>Final copied outputs, disclosure text, report exports, and material prepared for submission.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>paperforge/</code></td>
      <td>PaperForge drafts, review article outputs, quality checks, and revision loop outputs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>logs/</code></td>
      <td>Automatic model usage logs. Keep this folder if your thesis or journal requires AI disclosure.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can keep the default `~/thesis` path, or change it from `/settings` by editing `THESIS_ROOT`.

## Where outputs are saved

research-assistant has three kinds of saved work:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Output type</th>
      <th>Where to find it</th>
      <th>How to use it later</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Saved Q&amp;A sessions</td>
      <td><code>/sessions</code></td>
      <td>Return to previous questions, review cited answers, and delete sessions you no longer need.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Workspace files</td>
      <td><code>/workspace</code> and your <code>THESIS_ROOT</code> folder</td>
      <td>Continue writing, copy text into your thesis, or organize outputs into project folders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Project metadata</td>
      <td><code>/projects</code></td>
      <td>Reuse project title, research question, hypothesis, keywords, citation style, and supervisor notes across tools.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Model logs</td>
      <td><code>~/thesis/logs/</code> by default</td>
      <td>Generate AI disclosure text and review which model was used for which task.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PaperForge outputs</td>
      <td>The folder passed with <code>--output</code>, or the default output folder used by the module</td>
      <td>Review generated drafts, revision passes, and quality checks before using them in academic writing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Zotero indexed evidence</td>
      <td>Managed by the local index created from Zotero PDFs</td>
      <td>Use Ask, Evidence, Claim Verify, Audit, and Outline tools with citation aware retrieval.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## How to return to previous work

To continue a previous session, type:

```bash
ra
```

Your browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5050`.

Then:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Goal</th>
      <th>Go to</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Continue a saved question or answer</td>
      <td><code>/sessions</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Continue a thesis or manuscript file</td>
      <td><code>/workspace</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Check or change the active project</td>
      <td><code>/projects</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Check model usage and costs</td>
      <td><code>/orchestration</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Generate or review AI disclosure text</td>
      <td><code>ra-disclose</code> or the disclosure tools in the Web UI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Run another Zotero indexing pass</td>
      <td><code>/index</code> or <code>ra-researcher index</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Good practice:

```text
Before closing the app:
1. Copy important model outputs into a Workspace file.
2. Keep cited answers in Sessions if you may need the evidence trail later.
3. Export or save important drafts under the correct project folder.
4. Keep logs if you need transparent AI usage records.
```

## Safe use and backup

Do not commit private files, API keys, unpublished thesis drafts, Zotero PDFs, or model logs to a public GitHub repository.

Recommended backup items:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Back up</th>
      <th>Why</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>.env</code></td>
      <td>Contains your local configuration. Store it securely because it may contain API keys.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>THESIS_ROOT</code></td>
      <td>Contains your drafts, notes, outputs, logs, and project files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Zotero library</td>
      <td>Contains the papers and metadata used for citation aware retrieval.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A safe backup command for your thesis workspace is:

```bash
tar -czf thesis-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/thesis
```

For sensitive work, use encrypted storage or a private backup location.

## Complete uninstall

To remove research-assistant from your system:

### Automatic (if you still have the repo)

```bash
cd /path/to/research-assistant
bash scripts/uninstall_cli.sh
```

This removes:
- `~/.local/bin/research-assistant` (the CLI wrapper)
- `~/.local/share/applications/research-assistant.desktop` (desktop launcher)
- `~/.local/share/research-assistant/` (PID file and server logs)

### Manual (if you deleted the repo already)

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/research-assistant
rm -f ~/.local/share/applications/research-assistant.desktop
rm -rf ~/.local/share/research-assistant
```

### Clean up shell config

If you previously added the `ra` alias or PATH line to `~/.bashrc`, open the file and remove them:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Look for and delete these lines (if present):

```bash
# Added by research-assistant installer
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
alias ra="research-assistant"
```

### What is NOT removed (your research data)

These directories contain YOUR work and are never touched by the uninstaller:

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/thesis/` | Drafts, notes, outlines, sessions, logs |
| `~/thesis/chroma_db/` | Vector index of your papers |
| `~/.venvs/thesis/` | Python virtual environment |
| `~/Zotero/storage/` | Your Zotero PDF library |

To remove these as well (only if you're certain):

```bash
rm -rf ~/thesis ~/.venvs/thesis
```

## PaperForge

**PaperForge** is the multi-agent paper generation pipeline. It produces academic papers from codebases or research topics with an interactive web UI, ZeroGPT-aware writing, publication-quality charts, and Research Assistant tool integration.

### Web UI

Start the server and open `http://localhost:5055/paperforge`:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

The interactive UI guides you through 6 steps:

1. **Input** — code path + summary or research topic
2. **Generate** — Outline (RA) → Code Analyst → Writer → Paraphrase (RA), with real-time SSE progress
3. **Edit Draft** — per-section review with text selection, yellow highlighting, numbered feedback panels, and targeted revisions via Claude/DeepSeek
4. **Figures** — review generated charts, request regenerations with feedback
5. **Assess & Revise** — PF Assessor + RA Peer Review (structural, methodology, citation reviewers), automated revision loop
6. **Finalize** — Plagiarism Check + RA Claim Verify + RA External Match, download paper.md and paper.docx

Per-section features: Quick AI scoring, ZeroGPT checks with score persistence, version history with per-section revert (up to 10 versions), and state that survives server restarts.

### Pipeline

```
Outline (RA) → Code/Lit Analyst → Writer (+ structured FIG data)
    → Paraphrase (RA) → [Interactive Editing]
    → Assessor + Peer Review ×3 → Rewriter
    → Plagiarism + Claim Verify + External Match
    → Figure Gen (Chart MCP, 8 types) → Finalize + Disclose (RA)
```

### Key features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI-aware writing** | Writer prompt avoids ZeroGPT triggers (em dashes, formulaic phrases, uniform sentences). Per-section Quick AI scores + ZeroGPT checks. |
| **Structured figures** | Writer outputs `[FIG bar|title|categories|values]` format. Chart MCP renders 8 chart types at 300 DPI. |
| **RA integration** | Outline Recommender, Peer Review (3 reviewers), Claim Verify, External Match, Paraphrase, Disclose. |
| **State persistence** | All pipeline state on disk at `~/thesis/runs/<id>/`. Survives restarts. Atomic writes with per-job locking. |
| **DOCX export** | Times New Roman, embedded figures, AI-tell cleanup (**, em/en dashes stripped). |
| **Road-tested** | Generated a 7,600-word personalized medicine review (22% ZeroGPT) and a 25K-char EGFR MD simulation paper with 4 publication-quality charts. |

## Notes on responsible use

research-assistant is designed to support research, not replace academic judgment. Always verify claims, check citations, review generated text carefully, and follow the AI use policies of your university, journal, conference, or institution.

AI-assisted writing should be disclosed when required. The built-in logging and disclosure tools are intended to make this process easier.

## FAQ

### Do I need all API keys?

No. One provider is enough to start. More providers are useful for comparison and multi-agent workflows.

### Do I need Zotero?

Zotero is recommended if you want citation-aware Q&A over your own papers. Some writing and model comparison tools can still be used without Zotero.

### How long does indexing take?

Indexing time depends on the number and size of PDFs. Already indexed papers are skipped by Zotero item key unless re-indexing is forced.

### Can I use local models?

Yes. Ollama can be configured for local model workflows.

### Can I use a local embedding model?

Yes. For example, you can configure a local embedding model such as `ollama/nomic-embed-text` if your setup supports it.

### Is this a replacement for a supervisor or peer reviewer?

No. research-assistant helps with organization, drafting, evidence checking, and model comparison. Final academic judgment and responsibility remain with the researcher.
